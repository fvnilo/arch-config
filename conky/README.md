Config files for Conky
======================

Version used: 1.9.0

.conkyrc-dwm is for when dwm is the Window Manager. It outputs text to the console and then on the status bar.
.conkyrc-dzen2 does the same thing as .conky-dwm but outputs color via dzen.
.conkyrc-ob is a simple text monitor at the top of the screen.
.gmail.py is a separate script that is used to check how many unread mails there is in my gmail inbox

To use one of these files, just rename the one you want to use to .conkyrc and copy it to your home folder (e.g.: /home/nylo)
