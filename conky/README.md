Config files for Conky
======================

Version used: 1.9.0

.conkyrc-dwm is for when dwm is the Window Manager. It outputs text to the console and then on the status bar.
.conkyrc-ob is a simple text monitor at the top of the screen.

To use one of these two files, just rename the one you want to use to .conkyrc and copy it to your home folder (e.g.: /home/nylo)
