Config files for Conky
======================

Version used: 1.9.0

.conkyrc-dwm is for when dwm is the Window Manager. It outputs text to the console and then on the status bar.
.conkyrc-dzen2 does the same thing as .conky-dwm but outputs color via dzen.
.conkyrc-ob is a simple text monitor at the top of the screen.
.gmail.py is a separate script that is used to check how many unread mails there is in my gmail inbox
.conkyrc-i3 is for when i3 is the Window Manager. Be sure to also have the conky-i3bar file in ~/bin

To use one of these files, just rename the one you want to use to .conkyrc and copy it to your home folder (e.g.: /home/nylo)
